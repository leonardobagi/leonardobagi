### Hello!

I am a Brazilian JavaScript and NodeJS developer, and I try my best to contribute to some NPM packages out there

## Contributions

### [RBXMaster](https://github.com/leonardobagi/RBXMaster)
A browser extension first intended to help people with Roblox Promocodes (formerly called RobloxPromocodeMaster), made with my friend [CarBluG Studio](https://youtube.com/c/CarBluGStudio) (now owner of [@Roblox_RTC_BR](https://twitter.com/Roblox_RTC_BR) at Twitter). But then I decided to add new features like playlists and badge counting, I'll try my best to add more stuff there later.

### [geometry-dash.js](https://github.com/Aneks1/geometry-dash.js)
I am a contributor to the project hosted by [Aneks1](https://github.com/Aneks1), added a ton of cool stuff with the team and for sure learned that RobTop can't make decent APIs.

### [tmi-handler](https://github.com/EmanSza/tmi-handler)
This is the very first project I contributed to, and I had a really good time with it. [Eman](https://github.com/EmanSza) wasn't maintaining the package so actively because he was busy, so I tried my best to keep it active and decent as time wents by.

### [QTweet](https://github.com/atomheartother/QTweet)
This was a ride. I added slash commands for the bot and [Liz](https://github.com/atomheartother) and I really had some trouble discussing how to do some stuff, but it all ended well and...now the bot has slash commands! I really loved the experience of working with someone else (as it was my first time) and I hope we do more things in the near future.

### [discord.js-docs](https://github.com/TeeSeal/discord.js-docs)
Just added TS support because yea, that package deserves it.

### [timestampConv](https://github.com/Czekin/timestampConv)
Found this out of nowhere on NPM, and added types (I love adding TS support to things as you may have noticed)

## Next up
- JSF: Library for Vanilla JS development, the objective is to replace JQuery
- base-code-generator: Generate some passcodes based on a base
